# WordPress React Boilerplate

## Using the setup script:

The project contains a shell script (`replace.sh`) that replaces the placeholders in the plugin framework with user-defined values. The script facilitates the creation of a new plugin based on the boilerplate.

### Steps for use:

1. Make sure that you make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x replace.sh
2. execute the script:
   ````bash
   ./replace.sh
3. Provide the following information when prompted:
   - Plugin Name: The full name of your plugin (replaces My Plugin Name). 
   - Namespace Name: The namespace of your plugin (replaces MyPluginNamespace). 
   - Defined Name: The plugin constant (replaces MY_PLUGIN). 
   - Plugin Slug: The slug of your plugin (replaces my-plugin). 
   - Plugin Prefix: The prefix for your plugin functions (replaces my_plugin_name_).
4.	The script will replace the placeholders in the files, rename the main plugin file, and adjust the plugin directory accordingly.
5.	Once complete, your pluginâ€™s directory and files will be correctly set up.
