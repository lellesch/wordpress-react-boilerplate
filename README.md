# WordPress React Boilerplate

WordPress React Boilerplate is a boilerplate plugin for WordPress that enables a modern React integration and provides a clear structure for the separation of admin and frontend functions.

## Features

- Separation of admin and frontend areas 
- React integration for admin and frontend components 
- psr 4 autoloading 
- Hook registration for admin and frontend 
- Shortcodes for the frontend areaet.

## Using the setup script:

The project contains a shell script (`replace.sh`) that replaces the placeholders in the plugin framework with user-defined values. The script facilitates the creation of a new plugin based on the boilerplate.

### Steps for use:

1. Make sure that you make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x replace.sh
2. execute the script:
   ````bash
   ./replace.sh
3. Provide the following information when prompted:
   - Plugin Name: The full name of your plugin (replaces My Plugin Name). 
   - Namespace Name: The namespace of your plugin (replaces MyPluginNamespace). 
   - Defined Name: The plugin constant (replaces MY_PLUGIN). 
   - Plugin Slug: The slug of your plugin (replaces my-plugin). 
   - Plugin Prefix: The prefix for your plugin functions (replaces my_plugin_name_).
4.	The script will replace the placeholders in the files, rename the main plugin file, and adjust the plugin directory accordingly.
5.	Once complete, your pluginâ€™s directory and files will be correctly set up.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Translation Process

### Step 1: Start build so that the build code is created
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```


### Step 2: Create the .pot file

1. Open your console/terminal and run the command to generate the `.pot` files:
   ```bash
   npm run makepot
   ```
   **What happens:**
   - This command creates the `.pot` files for PHP and JavaScript files from the Admin and Public directories.
   - The generated `.pot` files for Admin and Public are merged with the main `.pot` file.
   - The temporary `.pot` files are deleted after merging.

### Step 3: Load the .pot file in Poedit

1. Open **Poedit** (or any other translation tool).
2. Select the generated `.pot` file from the `languages` directory of your plugin, for example:
   ```bash
   languages/my-plugin.pot
   ```
3. Load the `.pot` file in Poedit to start translating.

### Step 4: Save the translation

1. Translate all necessary text strings in Poedit.
2. Once the translation is complete, save the file as a `.po` file for the desired language, e.g.:
   ```bash
   languages/my-plugin-de_DE.po
   ```

### Step 5: Generate the .json files for JavaScript translations

1. After saving the translation as a `.po` file, run the `makejson` command to generate the `.json` files:
   ```bash
   npm run makejson
   ```
   **What happens:**
   - This command generates the necessary `.json` files based on the `.po` file for German (`de_DE`).
   - The `--no-purge` option ensures that existing `.json` files are not deleted.

### Customizing the `makejson` command:

If you've created translations for another language, you need to adjust the command accordingly. Example for French (`fr_FR`):
   ```bash
   wp i18n make-json languages/my-plugin-fr_FR.po --no-purge
   ```

### Summary:

1. **Create the `.pot` files**: Run the command `npm run makepot`.
2. **Translate the texts**: Load the `.pot` file in Poedit and save the translation as a `.po` file.
3. **Generate the `.json` files**: Run the command `npm run makejson` to generate the `.json` files.
